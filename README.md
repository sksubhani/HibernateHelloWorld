# HibernateHelloWorld

This is the very base project setup for Hibernate with JPA. <br>
We can plugin in the components and use in other projects. <br> <br>

It contains few transactions for demo purpose. The actual database can be obtained from <a href="http://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-sample-database.aspx">MySQL Sample Database</a>

Thank you. <br>
